        <p>
          The <i>Python in Astronomy</i> workshop aims to bring together researchers, Python developers, users, and educators, and will include presentations, tutorials, unconference sessions, discussion sessions, and sprints.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to sharing information about the state-of-the art of Python Astronomy packages, the meeting will focus on improving interoperability between astronomical Python packages, providing training for new contributors, and developing a common set of educational materials for Python in Astronomy. The meeting is therefore not only geared at current developers, but also users who are interested in becoming contributors, as well as educators.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Python in Astronomy workshop will be hosted by the Lorentz Center, which is an international center that coordinates and hosts workshops in the sciences, based on the philosophy that science thrives on interaction between creative researchers.
